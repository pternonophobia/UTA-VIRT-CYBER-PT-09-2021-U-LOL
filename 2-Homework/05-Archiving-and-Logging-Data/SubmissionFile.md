### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
    tar -xvf TarDocs.tar
2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
    tar -cvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude-tag-under=Java ~/Projects/TarDocs
3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
    tar -tf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -rw Java *
**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log
#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
    -c creats an archive, -x executes it, you cant execute an archive with nothing in it, or at the same time its created.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
    0 6 * * 3 tar -czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
    sudo mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Print memory to free_mem.txt
    free -mh > awk 'NR==2{printf "Memory Usage: %s/%sMB (%.2f%%)\n", $3,$2,$3*100/$2 }' > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

    # Print disk usage to disk_usage.txt
    df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{printf "Disk Usage: %d/%dGB (%s)\n", $3,$2,$5}' > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

    # List open files to open_list.txt
    lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

    # Print free disk space to free_disk.txt
    df -h >> ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
    sudo chmod +x system.sh
**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
    sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly
---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]
    ```
---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

6. Command to produce an audit report:

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
